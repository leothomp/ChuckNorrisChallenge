# ChuckNorrisChallenge
CSA DevNet Study Challenge

"Practicing Modern Software Development". We are touching on a few programming concepts like Serialization vs. Deserialization, Parsing common serial data formats and an introduction to version control with Git.

The Challenge: Tell me a Chuck Norris joke
- please create a repository at github.com and use Git to track all of your changes
- for those uncomfortable with a blank sheet of paper, I will supply a git repository with partially completed code as a boiler plate on Monday.
- please use api.chucknorris.io as your API
- please track any required external libraries in a requirements.txt
- please use requests as your HTTP library

Success Criteria:
- I should be able to clone your repository, pip install -r requirements.txt, python {your_script_name}.py and see a Chuck Norris joke printed to the console.
- The Chuck Norris joke should display cleanly with no surrounding quotes, symbols or superfluous carriage return symbols. Just the jokes, ma'am.
